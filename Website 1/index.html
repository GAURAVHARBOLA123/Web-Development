            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the
                knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved
                orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to
                the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned
                through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle
                Kingdom.[2]

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development. Educational methods
                include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes
                place under the guidance of educators; however, learners can also educate themselves. Education can take
                place in formal or informal settings, and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one
                thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The Aztecs had schools for the noble youths called Calmecac where they
                would receive rigorous religious and military training. The Aztecs also had a well-developed theory
                about education, which has an equivalent word in Nahuatl called tlacahuapahualiztli. It means "the art
                of raising or educating a person",[6] or "the art of strengthening or bringing up men".[7] This was a
                broad conceptualization of education, which prescribed that it begins at home, supported by formal
                schooling, and reinforced by community living. Historians cite that formal education was mandatory for
                everyone regardless of social class and gender.[8]</p>
